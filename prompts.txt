The following prompts were fed into Claude Code for the vibe session

First Prompt (Small visual enhacments) DONE:
---------------------------------------

Following the Advanced Visualization Requirements in the PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS, implement these specific enhancements to scripts/07_visualization.py:

1. DISCOVERY TIMELINE 3D CONVERSION:
   - Convert create_discovery_timeline() to use plotly.graph_objects.Scatter3d
   - Add Z-axis for timeline with years (1900-2030 range)
   - Map approach_year to z-axis, distance_au to x-axis, magnitude to y-axis
   - Implement risk_category color mapping: HIGH_RISK='#8B0000', MEDIUM_RISK='#CD5C5C', LOW_RISK='#FFA0A0', VERY_LOW='#FFD0D0'
   - Add 3D camera controls and rotation animations for presentation mode

2. STORAGE EFFICIENCY LEGEND IMPLEMENTATION:
   - In create_storage_efficiency_comparison(), add explicit legend with specified colors
   - Color mapping: CSV='#800080', Parquet='#008000', DuckDB='#FFD700', Iceberg='#0000FF'
   - Position legend at bottom-center with horizontal orientation
   - Add legend title 'Storage Format Types'

3. RISK ASSESSMENT INDIVIDUAL LEGENDS:
   - Modify create_risk_assessment_dashboard() subplot configuration
   - Add individual legend for each of the 4 subplots positioned on the left side
   - Use showlegend=True for each trace with legend positioning: x=-0.1, y=0.5 relative to each subplot
   - Ensure legends don't overlap with chart content
4. PERFORMANCE_COMPARISON:
  -  Add left-positioned legends to all charts: legend=dict(x=-0.15, y=0.5)
  - Apply color scheme: CSV='#800080', Parquet='#008000', DuckDB='#FFD700', Iceberg='#0000FF'
  - Remove 'Performance Trend' from legend: set showlegend=False for that trace

- Ask me any questions if you think there is anything unclear and also update the PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS with the new specs from here if you find anything contradictory. 



Second Prompt (Let's break everything) DONE: 
-----------------------------------------
Implement comprehensive dataset expansion and advanced risk assessment segmentation in the space analytics pipeline:
FULL DATASET DOWNLOAD:
   - Modify scripts/02_data_ingestion.py SimpleDataLoader class
   - Remove ALL size limitations from download_neo_data() method
   - Update NASA JPL API call to fetch complete dataset: '?date-min=1900-01-01&date-max=2100-12-31&dist-max=10&fullname=true&diameter=true'
   -  Update scripts/05_performance_benchmarks.py to handle datasets >100K records
   - Add memory usage monitoring and query optimization for large datasets
   - Implement data sampling strategies for visualization performance
 TEMPORAL RISK ASSESSMENT SEGMENTATION:
   - Completely rebuild create_risk_assessment_dashboard() in scripts/07_visualization.py
   - Create TWO separate dashboard sections using make_subplots(rows=2, cols=1, subplot_titles=['Historical & Present (≤2025)', 'Future Approaches (≥2026)'])
   - Section 1: Filter data WHERE approach_year <= 2025, create 2x2 subplot grid with same risk visualizations
   - Section 2: Filter data WHERE approach_year >= 2026, create 2x2 subplot grid with future projections and trend analysis
   - Add comparative statistics between historical and future risk patterns
   - Implement cross-section filtering: clicking on historical data highlights corresponding future trends  
 PERFORMANCE TESTING WITH FULL DATASET:
   - Update scripts/05_performance_benchmarks.py to handle datasets >100K records     
Execute pipeline end-to-end
 Ask me any questions if you feel there is anything unclear and also update the PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS with the new specs from here if you find anything contradictory. 


Third Prompt (Big enhancment) FUTURE WORK: 
-----------------------------------
reate a comprehensive Streamlit application that integrates all space analytics components while preserving existing codebase:

1. PROJECT STRUCTURE SETUP:
   - Create new directory: streamlit_app/ with subdirectories: pages/, components/, utils/
   - Preserve ALL existing scripts/, notebooks/, data/ folders unchanged
   - Create streamlit_app/main.py as entry point and streamlit_app/requirements.txt

2. STREAMLIT APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE:
   - Main dashboard: streamlit_app/main.py with navigation sidebar
   - Multi-page structure: pages/data_overview.py, pages/risk_analysis.py, pages/performance_benchmarks.py, pages/time_travel_demo.py
   - Import and utilize existing classes: SimpleDataLoader, SimpleDuckDB, IcebergManager, SpaceDataVisualizer, SimpleAnalytics from scripts/
   - Implement st.cache_data for performance with large datasets

3. INTERACTIVE FEATURES IMPLEMENTATION:
   - Data Overview Page: Interactive filters for date ranges, object types, risk levels with real-time chart updates
   - Risk Analysis Page: Dual-timeline dashboard (historical vs future) with sidebar controls for threshold adjustments
   - Performance Page: Live benchmarking tool with user-selectable query types and format comparisons
   - Time Travel Page: Interactive timeline slider for querying historical snapshots with schema evolution demonstration

4. ADVANCED STREAMLIT COMPONENTS:
   - Implement st.plotly_chart() for all existing visualizations from 07_visualization.py
   - Add st.sidebar filters: date range picker, risk threshold sliders, object classification multiselect
   - Create custom components using st.columns() for side-by-side comparisons
   - Add st.download_button for exporting filtered datasets and visualizations
   - Implement st.progress and st.spinner for long-running operations

5. INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:
   - Config file: streamlit_app/config.py that imports from existing config/ directory
   - Data loading: Use existing data pipeline without modification
   - Error handling: Graceful fallbacks when data/database unavailable
   - Responsive design: Optimized for both desktop presentation and laptop development

Create startup script: streamlit_app/run.sh with: 'streamlit run main.py --server.port 8501 --server.address 0.0.0.0'
Test complete application functionality including data loading, visualization rendering, and interactive filtering"
 Ask me any questions if you feel there is anything unclear and also update the PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS with the new specs from here if you find anything contradictory.
